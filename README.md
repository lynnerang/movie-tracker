# MovieTrackr App

This project is a Turing front-end evelopment project focused on working with React, Redux, and and Enzyme/Jest.

This is an app for people who would like to browse through movies and keep track of their favorites.  It displays movies in various categories like top rates and in theatres on the home page, and you can click into categories to view all movies of that category.  You can view the full details of movies by clicking on each movie link.

## UI Design

The spec we were given had no information on UI design elements, so we started by wireframing a general idea of our layout.

Then we created a high-fidelity prototype of the design on Figma to have a more detailed idea of where we wanted everything to go on the different web pages.
